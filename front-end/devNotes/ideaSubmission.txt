I'm trying to lay-out the data needed from a user while he's submitting an idea for projects:

Title: text (max 60? chars)
Description: text (max 400? chars)

Tags: multi-choice text categories (names of software, apis, tools, concepts, programming languages) --at least 3!

*Links: text (hyper-links related to the subject of the idea)

*psudo-code/snippets: MarkUp-text (example or direction of how to implement/ useful code snippets)

*== optional

And the server-generated data relating to a new idea:

id: number (sequential - for now, uuid might be better)
